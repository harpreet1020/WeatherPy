## WeatherPy

Website including scatter plots and analysis can be viewed at https://harpreet1020.github.io

Created Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities across the world. To accomplish this, I used the [citipy](https://pypi.org/project/citipy/) library, and the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to create a representative model of weather across world cities.

Using matplotlib, I built a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

I also built scatter plots that highlighted:

* Global Temperatures
* Global Humidity 
* Global Cloudiness
* Global Wind Speeds

### Tableau
* I used Tableau to recreate the charts and to make them interactive.
* Published the charts to Tableau Public and placed them in iframes within the HTML
